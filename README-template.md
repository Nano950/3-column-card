## My process
I tried to build the page one layer at a time, starting with the cards themselves, and working my way thorugh each aspect of the site, rather than focusing on one card at a time, or random parts of the design.


### Built with

- Flexbox

### What I learned

I think mostly this project was good review for what I learned a while ago. I have an aversion to starting project becauase I fear how long it will take me to finish it, along with the frustration of running into problems, but after starting and actually commiting to getting it done, the process was surprisingly smooth. One thing that i did learn about though, was the "doc" shortcut. 

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

Taking notes of what I did in each project, and the problems that I run into, along with the solutions I come up with, is definitely something that I want to continue practicing. as far as coding goes, I want to get faster at making creative descions, and better understand differnet ways that I can get a desired visual appearence.
